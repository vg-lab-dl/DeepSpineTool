# DeepSpineTool
This repository contains our GUI application for automatic spine segmentation and refinement. 

![preview](./assets/preview.png)

## Installation for Windows 10
We provide an executable ready to run in Windows 10. To have short segmentation times, we recommend running our application on a system with an NVIDIA GPU with at least 8 GB of VRAM. Otherwise, the segmentation process will be done on CPU and will be slower.
To use this executable:
1. Download `DeepSpineNetTool.zip` from https://bit.ly/3usWxyv
2. Extract the previous file
3. Open the newly extracted folder and execute `DeepSpineNetTool.bat` 

If you have a compatible GPU, please ensure that your GPU drivers are up-to-date.

## Building and installation (any system)
Our application can also be installed in any operating system that supports its dependencies. It requires **Python 3.6.8 or later** and **CUDA 10.1** (to enable the use of GPUs to greatly reduce the automatic segmentation time. It can be used without CUDA on CPU, with a longer execution time.).

1. Download the current project:
   > git clone https://github.com/vg-lab-dl/DeepSpineTool.git
2. Install dependencies (from the root directory of the project):
   > pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Download our models (`models.zip`) from https://bit.ly/3usWxyv
4. Extract the previous file in the root folder of the project. 

After the previous steps, folder structure should be:
* `DeepSpineTool`
     * `app`
     * `models`
        * `M1`
        * `M2`
        * `M3`
     * ...
 
## Usage
To present our application functionality, we provide a sample project. It can be downloaded from: https://bit.ly/3usWxyv (`sample.scn`) 

#### Running the application
* To start the tool, use the following command (if using the executable: Open `DeepSpineNetTool.bat`):
    > python main.py

* Once the main window appears, in the upper menu, open the sample project with  `Scene` > `Load` and accept the prompt message.
* Locate the sample project and open it.

#### View an image
* To view the image, select it in the `Scene Manager` pane, for example, you can choose `ROI_RAW_test6.tif`
* In the upper menu, hover on `Image` > `Viewers` and click on `Basic Image 3D Viewer` 

#### Segment an image
* To segment the image, select `ROI_RAW_test6.tif` in the `Scene Manager` pane
* In the upper menu, hover on `Segmentation` > `Deep Learning` and click one of `M1` `M2` or `M3` (If no option shows when hovering over `Deep Learning`, the model folder has not been placed correctly, please check the installation instruction)
* Click on the `Close when finished` checkbox from the progress prompt and wait for the process to finish
* The segmented image has been added to the `Scene Manager` pane (`ROI_RAW_test6.tif (Seg: u_net3d_deep)`) and can be viewed following the steps from the previous section

#### Edit a segmentation
* To edit the segmentation, select `ROI_RAW_test6.tif` and `ROI_RAW_test6.tif (Seg: u_net3d_deep)`(or `ROI_LABEL_test6.tif` if you didn't perform the automatic segmentation) in the `Scene Manager` pane.
* In the upper menu, hover over `Segmentation` and click on `Segmentation Editor`.
* In the prompt, select the prediction image, `ROI_RAW_test6.tif (Seg: u_net3d_deep)` (or `ROI_LABEL_test6.tif` if you didn't perform the automatic segmentation), from the list. The segmentation editor will open.
* Our app stores the changes in an automatically created image (`edition_ROI_RAW_test6.tif (Seg: u_net3d_deep)`), if you want to save the current work and continue it later, next time you will have
 to open the editor with the 3 images selected: `ROI_RAW_test6.tif`, `ROI_RAW_test6.tif (Seg: u_net3d_deep)` and `edition_ROI_RAW_test6.tif (Seg: u_net3d_deep)`.
